# EmployeeReactDirectory

* This is an employee directory app with React. As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Usage / Directions
* Click the link to find the Employee https://brc9087.github.io/myapp/
